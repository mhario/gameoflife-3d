# 3D Game of Life

## What do?

Conway's Game of Life was a 2-dimensional grid of 'cells' which were either 'alive' or 'dead,' and the cells would change states each turn of the game based on their number of living neighbors. There exist several attempts to convert Conway's version of the game into a 3-Dimensional environment, and their rules differ slightly. 

This repository is an attempt to offer a number of rulesets in one place. It was originally created as a "Hackathon" project for FullStack Academy, and was produced over only three days, by only one guy: Me! Mark Hario. Thank you for checking out the 3D Game of Life!

## What now?

The initial commit for this GitHub repo was created with the results of the "Stackathon" project, mentioned above. As it was a hack-athon style project, there exist several clear opportunities for refactoring. I intend to continue implementing these refactors--along with other projects--to continue practicing JavaScript while pursuing employment. These refactors will be tracked on GitHub, using Waffle.io. 

Again, thank you for downloading! I would welcome any feedback, and can be contacted by email, here: hario.mark@gmail.com. I can also be reached on LinkedIn, [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-hario-6b871285/)
